            Archetypes are important to understand because it helps an individual understand themselves better.

        </p>
        <p>All archetypes have a set of unique characteristics attached to each other. However, these characteristics are strengths and weaknesses that y0u may relate to. Such as the creator archetype, its strengths include having an imaginative mindset and the feeling to seek innovation in their daily life, its weaknesses include the constant fear of what is and isn't an illusion, and the feeling to do something due to fear of failure. These characteristics help an individual understand what they need to focus on, what needs improvements, and how they enforce their strengths.</p>
